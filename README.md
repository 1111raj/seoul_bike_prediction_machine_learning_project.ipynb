# Seoul Bike Prediction - Machine Learning Project

Overview
This project, Seoul Bike Prediction, uses machine learning techniques to forecast the number of shared bikes rented in Seoul based on various environmental and seasonal factors. Using data from the Seoul Bike Sharing system, the project seeks to analyze the relationships between weather patterns, temperature, and time-related variables to accurately predict daily bike rental counts.

Project Goals
Predict Bike Rental Demand: Build an accurate model to predict the number of bikes rented in Seoul.
Identify Key Influencing Factors: Examine the impact of weather and seasonal features on bike demand.
Optimize Model Performance: Experiment with multiple algorithms to find the most effective model for prediction.
Dataset
The dataset contains information on hourly bike rentals, weather conditions, and temporal data points. Key variables include:

Date: The specific day of data collection.
Hour: Time of day (hourly intervals).
Temperature: Temperature (in Celsius).
Humidity: Humidity level as a percentage.
Wind Speed: Speed of wind in km/h.
Visibility: Visibility in meters.
Dew Point Temperature: Dew point in Celsius.
Solar Radiation: Solar radiation levels in MJ/m2.
Rainfall: Rainfall in mm.
Snowfall: Snowfall in cm.
Holiday: Whether the day is a public holiday.
Functioning Day: Whether the system was operational on the day.
Bike Count: The target variable, which indicates the count of bikes rented.
The dataset is pre-processed to handle missing values, and feature engineering techniques are applied to maximize the predictive power of the model.

Approach
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Investigate data distributions and relationships among features.
Visualize trends and patterns in bike rental counts over time, examining hourly, daily, and seasonal variations.
Analyze the impact of weather conditions on bike rentals.
2. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values and outliers.
Encode categorical features (e.g., Holiday and Functioning Day).
Normalize and scale features to improve model performance.
3. Feature Engineering
Add meaningful derived features, such as day of the week, weekend vs. weekday, peak hours, and other time-based features.
4. Model Selection and Training
Multiple machine learning algorithms are tested, including:
Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
XGBoost
Neural Networks
Models are evaluated using performance metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R^2.
5. Model Evaluation
Compare models to select the best one based on accuracy and generalizability.
Use validation data to test the model's predictive capabilities on unseen data.
6. Hyperparameter Tuning
Fine-tune the model using Grid Search and/or Random Search to optimize hyperparameters.
Results
The projectâ€™s best model achieved the following performance:

R^2 Score: (Add Score)
RMSE: (Add Score)
MAE: (Add Score)
This indicates that the model can accurately predict bike rentals in Seoul under different environmental and seasonal conditions.

Conclusion
Through this project, we successfully built a predictive model for bike rentals in Seoul. We also gained valuable insights into the factors that influence bike-sharing demand, providing potential benefits for city planners, service operators, and stakeholders to optimize resources and improve service availability.
